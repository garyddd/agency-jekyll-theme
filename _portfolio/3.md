**To the Editor:** Characterizing tumor-infiltrat-ing T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire is a critical step toward identifying cancer antigens and developing new immunotherapies1.We pre-viously developed a computational algorithm named TRUST2,3 to extract TCR hypervariable complementarity-determining region 3(CDR3)sequences from unselected bulk tumor RNA sequencing(RNA-seq)data.When applied to large cancer cohorts, TRUST found associa-tions between tumor mutation load and TCR repertoires2.A recent study by Bolotin et al. reported a new version of their MiXCR tool that enables assembly of TCR clonotypes from RNA-seq data.In comparing MiXCR to TRUST, Bolotin et al. concluded that MiXCR was supe-rior and that the output of TRUST includes unconfirmed and potentially false positive results.Here, we point out important differ-ences between TRUST and MiXCR, as well as differences in interpretation of results, which may complicate direct comparison of the tools.
